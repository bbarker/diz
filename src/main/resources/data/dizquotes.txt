===''Kingdom Hearts II''===
*"''I'm glad we have the opportunity to speak like this, my friend. I'm intrigued by your hypothesis...and I'm finding it difficult to stave off the urge to test it. Still, I'm concerned about the stability of the worlds.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Mickey.</small>
*"''The doors that appeared. The place the Heartless seek. I fear my research may have brought this upon us...''"<br/>— <small>talking to Mickey.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories''===
====Reverse/Rebirth====
*"''Sleep. Here, between light and dark.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku at the beginning of Reverse/Rebirth.</small>
*"''Your king is far away. Sleep, and leave the war with darkness in his hands. The thorny light of awakening will bring only anguish to one in your state. Turn from the light. Shut your eyes.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Can you face the truth? Here, blanketed by the darkness, sleep is safety. Sleep is eternal.''"<br/>— <small>before giving Riku a card.</small>
*"''It is a door to the truth. Take it, and your sleep ends. Take it, and take the first step toward the truth. But know this: The truth will bring you pain. Will you still go? There can be no returning to the sweet security of sleep.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''What you see is not real. It's the world of your memory. The things you remember of Maleficent's castle from your time there. Those memories became a card, and that card made this world. The things you see—you've seen them all before, haven't you?''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Ordinarily...yes. You would meet the people in your memories.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''It must be nice being back in your old bedroom. Think of all the memories...''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''So she did. And you lived here, tempted by the darkness she offered. You cast away your home, your friends, everything... But at least they gave you a nice room.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku about Maleficent.</small>
*"''But you cast them aside. To reach the outside world, you passed through the door to darkness. Behind you, you left family, friends, home—everything—all in pursuit of darkness.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Then what do you have to show for it? First your home, then the dark. Your heart only knows how to throw things away. It's empty, like that room. Like your memories. That's why no one is in the castle with you. Your heart is hollow except for the darkness you couldn't quite shake off.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Why do you shun the dark?''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Darkness is your weapon. I need you to accept it.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Stop resisting and accept the darkness. You must...if you are to serve me again!''"<br/>— <small>transforming to Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.</small>
*"''Clever boy. You'll make a fine host. Now, surrender to me again and—''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Did you really think you could harm me? A weakling like you couldn't even defeat Sora—and you had darkness on your side.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''You need the darkness. Submit! Bow to the darkness, and bow to me.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''You think some feeble light can save you from the darkness I command? Fool!''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''It seems you are intent on resisting the darkness. Very well. See with your own eyes.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''They are cards crafted from your memory. Advance through the worlds they beget, and you will come to understand... Chasing the light will not distance you from the dark. You cannot run.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''I tempered the darkness that remains in your heart.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Whether or not you use it is your choice. I'll be waiting, Riku...for you to come to your senses and yield to the darkness!''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Fake? Oh, I don't think that's the right word.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku about Riku Replica.</small>
*"''A copy, yes—or maybe a model. He is an example of what you should be. He accepts the darkness...just as you once accepted me. But now you are afraid. Perhaps YOU are the one who is being fake.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku about Riku Replica.</small>
*"''In the card-worlds, you grappled desperately with the darkness. Desperation is a product of fear. You fight the darkness because it frightens you.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Tsk, so stubborn. Then continue your fight, if you must. Eventually, you will see. You cannot resist the dark.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''His Majesty is not here. You must battle me and the darkness alone!''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Giving up already? Then accept your fate, and accept Ansem as your master!''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Correct. Call me DiZ—it's as good a name as any. I've been watching you all along.''"<br/>— <small>introducing himself to Riku as DiZ.</small>
*"''You are special. You exist between light and dark. You stand in the twilight. I want you to meet Naminé, then choose.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Nobody...or anybody. It all depends on whether you choose to believe in me or not.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku.</small>
*"''And you pushed away slumber and chose to face Ansem.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''It was your answer. I'm just here to watch.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''You choose. Then you need only believe in your choice. That card will draw the darkness inside you out into this world. Finish your business with Ansem.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>
*"''Will you take the road to light—or the road to darkness?''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku.</small>
*"''You mean the twilit road to nightfall?''"<br/>— <small>to Riku.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories''===
====Reverse/Rebirth====
*"''Stop resisting. Accept the darkness. You have no choice... if you are to serve me again!''"<br>— <small>before appearing before Riku.</small>
*"''Clever boy. I knew you'd be the one to most appropriately serve me. And now, surrender to me again---''"<br>— <small>provoking Riku to attack him.</small>
*"''You are weak. You need darkness. Surrender. Bow to darkness. Bow to me.''"<br>— <small>trying to get Riku to give in to the darkness.</small>
*"''You think that feeble little light can save you from the darkness that I command? You shall feel my dark powers---in your bones!''"<br>— <small>before battling Riku.</small>
*"''This is a card crafted from your memory. Advance through the world it creates and soon, you will understand... Chasing after light is not the way. It will not give you distance from the darkness. There is no running from the darkness.''"<br>— <small>after giving Riku some cards.</small>
*"''To use it or not is your choice. I'll be waiting, Riku... for you to sense it and yield to the darkness in your heart!''"<br>— <small>before departing.</small>
*"''More like a model. He is an example of what you should try to be. He accepts the darkness... just like you once couldn't help but accept me. But now you are afraid. Perhaps YOU are the one who is being fake. Fake when you pretend to have no fear.''"<br>— <small>discussing Riku's replica.</small>
*"''Inside of the card-worlds... you grappled desperately with the darkness. Desperation is fear. You fight the darkness because it is what frightens you.''"<br>— <small>talking about Riku's fear.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days''===
*"''You seem to be struggling.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Naminé.</small>
*"''A Nobody?''"<br/>— <small>to Naminé.</small>
*"''Oh, I think he can do without a memory or two.''"<br/>— <small>to Naminé about Sora.</small>
*"''Naminé... You are a witch who has power over Sora's memories and those connected to him. Are you seeing something I cannot?''"<br/>— <small>talking to Naminé.</small>
*"''Then so be it. The gloves must come off.''"<br/>— <small>talking about taking action to wake Sora.</small>
*"''Those Nobodies had no business existing in the first place—as you know fully well, Naminé.''"<br/>— <small>talking about the Nobodies.</small>
*"''It appears we've come to a standstill.''"<br/>— <small>to Naminé.</small>
*"''This has gone on long enough. Riku... I think you know what needs to be done.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku.</small>
*"''Naminé, they've found us! They are on their way! That blasted puppet led them right to our doorstep! See what you get for trusting it?''"<br/>— <small>talking to Naminé when the Organization finds them.</small>

====''Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX''====
*"''The gloves must come off then.''"
*"''Nobodies never should have existed—as I'm sure you understand, Naminé.''"
*"''Naminé, it's them! The Organization has found us! They're almost here! This blasted puppet led them right to our doorstep! See what you get for trusting it?''"

===''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix''===
*"''Oh, he told you how he "felt," did he? Ridiculous. A Nobody cannot feel anything.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts II''===
*"''If we can maintain the simulated town until Naminé finishes chaining together Sora's memories.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem about Roxas.</small>
*"''He holds half of Sora's power within him. In the end, he'll have to give it back. Until then, he'll need another personality to throw off his pursuers.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem about Roxas.</small>
*"''It's the fate of a Nobody.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem, transporting Roxas to the simulated town.</small>
*"''His heart is returning. Doubtless he'll awaken very soon.''"<br/>— <small>after Roxas blacks out.</small>
*"''Organization miscreants... They've found us.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''Both are nothing but data to them. The fools could never tell the difference. We are running out of time. Naminé must make haste.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''We'd be giving the enemy another entry point.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem about the beach in the simulated Twilight Town.</small>
*"''We can always buy some sea-salt ice cream. Objects from that town must be kept out of the real world. You can delete that.''"<br/>— <small>joking to Riku-Ansem about the munny pouch.</small>
*"''No... Naminé hijacked the data herself. Look what she's done now... She's totally beyond my control!''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''It doesn't matter. As long as Naminé accomplishes her goal...we needn't worry about what befalls Roxas.''"<br/>— <small>talking about Naminé.</small>
*"''Roxas, this man speaks nonsense!''"<br/>— <small>appearing before Axel and Roxas.</small>
*"''Naminé's encounter with Roxas put his heart in contact with Kairi's. And that, in turn, affected Sora. You see?''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''She wasn't born like other Nobodies. She can interfere with the hearts and memories of Sora and those aligned with him.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''I could tell you... But first, perhaps you could tell me your true name.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''It's an honor, Ansem!''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''Now...what about you? Are the holes in your memory starting to fill in?''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''The same thing is happening to everyone who had ties to Sora. Very soon, to them, he'll be like a good friend who's gone away for a year.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem.</small>
*"''Revenge.''"<br/>— <small>to Riku-Ansem about what he wants.</small>
*"''Now, for the finishing touches. First, we must dispose of Naminé. She did a splendid job with Sora, but it's high time she disappeared. Roxas isn't the only one who was never meant to exist. Take care of it, Ansem.''"<br/>— <small>talking to "Ansem".</small>
*"''Roxas, to the mansion! The time has come!''"<br/>— <small>talking to Roxas.</small>
*"''There's no knowledge that has the power to change your fate.''"<br/>— <small>to Roxas.</small>
*"''A Nobody doesn't have a right to know. Nor does it even have the right to be.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Roxas about Nobodies.</small>
*"''No further outbursts!''"<br/>— <small>to Naminé.</small>
*"''At last, the Keyblade's chosen one.''"<br/>— <small>meeting Roxas in the Capsule Room.</small>
*"''To half of Sora, of course. You reside in darkness. What I need is someone who can move about the realm of light and destroy Organization XIII.''"<br/>— <small>to Roxas.</small>
*"''I am a servant of the world. And, if I'm a servant, then you should consider yourself a tool, at best.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Roxas.</small>
*"''My apologies. This is only a data-based projection.''"<br/>— <small>to Roxas.</small>
*"''You should share some of that hatred with Sora. He's far too nice for his own good.''"<br/>— <small>before Roxas slashes him with his Keyblade.</small>
*"''It's been too long, my friend.''"<br/>— <small>when Mickey finds him in The World That Never Was.</small>
*"''Xemnas, the Organization's Superior, is the Nobody of Xehanort, my foremost apprentice. The burden was mine to bear.''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''I won't deny there was more. I was...obsessed with thoughts of revenge. My apprentices stole everything precious to me—my research, and my pride.''"<br/>— <small>talking about himself.</small>
*"''He must be with his friends by now. Riku was a great help to me. I found him wandering the darkness, after you and he lost track of each other.''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''I am to blame. When I met Riku the first time he still had the appearance of a boy. Probably because he had such a strong heart. I asked him to find a young man named Roxas from Organization XIII, and bring him to me. When I told him it would help Sora awaken from his slumber, Riku left without a word. He fought Roxas. And I can only surmise Riku lost that fight. Riku must have realized then: to fight in the realm of darkness, he would have to immerse himself in that same darkness. And when he did...you saw what became of him. When Riku brought Roxas back to me, he was introducing himself...as Ansem. If that was what it took to awaken his friend, he was ready to live in darkness. Riku was the victim of my revenge. ...Oh, how my heart ached. I could only laugh to hide my shame.''"<br/>— <small>talking about Riku.</small>
*"''My friend, the time has come. I must make amends to these young people.''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''Sora and Riku are together. We have no part to play here.''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''Riku chose that form so he could use the power of darkness. It won't be easy.''"<br/>— <small>explaining Riku's appearance.</small>
*"''It's a device to reclaim Kingdom Hearts and encode it as data.''"<br/>— <small>explaining the Kingdom Hearts Encoder.</small>
*"''I do not claim to know the outcome of this venture, either. After all... Hearts are unpredictable.''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''I'm a fool. I've spent years studying the workings of the heart. Yet it seems I still haven't learned a thing!''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''The process of encoding hearts is incalculable. The inhabitants of my Twilight Town were data created from real hearts. I was convinced that they would think and behave the way I had envisioned—but I couldn't have been more wrong. A heart is so much more than any system. I saw it when Roxas and Kairi crossed paths. I knew. But I was too stubborn to accept it. It's always the same. I try to wrap my mind around things my heart already knows, only to fail. While I was trying to bring Sora back, I had so many plans in store. But once Sora was an acting force, they fell apart. All my research amounted to nothing, compared with that one boy's heart.''"<br/>— <small>talking about his research, hearts and Sora.</small>
*"''All the more proof that hearts cannot be contained by data. Run, my friend! It's going to self-destruct, and anything could happen!''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''Sora, the rest is up to you... And Roxas—I doubt you can hear me—but...I am sorry.''"<br/>— <small>to Sora and Roxas.</small>
*"''My heart is telling me what I must do. Please allow me to do what it says!''"<br/>— <small>to Mickey.</small>
*"''Have your laugh. I deserve as much for failing to see you for the fool you are.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Xemnas.</small>
*"''I admit...my disregard brought chaos to more worlds than one. But what were YOU seeking? You erased me from the world, only to take my name and continue research better left forgotten... Is this the answer you've been looking for?''"<br/>— <small>talking to Xemnas.</small>
*"''Xehanort. Foolish apprentice of a foolish man. You have surpassed nothing—only proved how little we both know. We may profess to know the heart, but its essence is beyond our reach. We're both ignorant—as oblivious as when we began. I'm afraid that any world you try to create... Any world of yours...would be an empire of ignorance. That is why you and your creation are destined to fall!''"<br/>— <small>talking to Xemnas.</small>
*"''We've said enough! Riku, you know what to do! King Mickey, my friend, forgive me! Farewell!''"<br/>— <small>before the Kingdom Hearts Encoder explodes.</small>

==="Blank Points"===
*"''Why, hello. It's not often I get visitors.''"<br/>— <small>meeting Aqua.</small>
*"''Well...I can tell you this is my second time on these shores. But unfortunately, much like the first, I do not remember who I am or whence I came. Everything was washed away in whatever currents carried me here.''"<br/>— <small>talking about how he got here and his memories fading.</small>
*"''You wish to return to your own world?''"<br/>— <small>asking Aqua.</small>
*"''Your friends? Somewhere in the scraps of memory I have left, you remind me of a boy I once knew. He is very much like you—true to his friends, and kind. This boy travels to many worlds and fights to keep the light safe.''"<br/>— <small>talking about Sora.</small>
*"''Sad to say, they nearly fell to darkness more than once. But at every turn, that boy arrived with Keyblade in hand to save the day.''"<br/>— <small>when Aqua asks about the worlds.</small>
*"''Neither of those, I'm afraid.''"<br/>— <small>denying that the boy's name is Terra or Ven.</small>
*"''How long has it been since I met him? At least a year now, perhaps more... Back then, my heart was clouded with vengeance. I did terrible things...both to him and his friends. I brought unhappiness to more lives than one. I felt something must be done. Was that why? A means of clearing my conscience? Or perhaps, out of a sort of scholarly instinct? While the boy slept his long sleep, I hid the results of my research inside him, transplanting the data to where it might best serve a purpose. In fact, I would like to believe... Maybe he can set things right. A boy like him who touches so many hearts—he could open the right door, and save all those people whose lives I managed to ruin. So many are still waiting for their new beginning, their birth by sleep. Even me...and even you.''"<br/>— <small>talking about Sora and what he did.</small>
*"''His name...is...''"<br/>— <small>after Aqua asks for the boy's name.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance''===
*"''You were not the visitor I expected.''"<br/>— <small>upon meeting Riku inside Sora.</small>
*"''Perhaps I wanted to atone for events of the past, even if no apology can undo the harm I have wrought. I felt...that I ought to leave at least something behind. So I digitized myself and my research, and hid them within Sora.''"<br/>— <small>telling Riku how he got inside Sora.</small>
*"''Yes. A clue, I hope, to finding yourselves or your lost friends in your hour of need. The heart has always been quick to grow. Each exposure to light, to the natural world, to other people, shapes this most malleable part inside of us. Nobodies are not different from us in that manner. Sora was the only one able to return to his human form without destroying his Nobody. That is a statement to the love in his heart for other people, and the bonds that tie them together. Perhaps...he has the power to bring back the hearts and existences of those connected to him—to recreate people we thought were lost to us forever. Our most precious treasures—even an empty puppet—the trees of the forest, and the petals on the wind—there are hearts around us everywhere we look. And it does not take superhuman powers to see them. Surely we remember as children the way our hearts made everything seem so shiny, and perfect. Sora has a heart like that—uncorrupted, willing to see the good before the bad. When he sees the heart in something, it then becomes real. When a connection seems broken, he may have the power to mend it. He has touched countless hearts, he has accepted them, and he has saved them. And some of those hearts have never left him—whether they fell into darkness or were trapped there—whether they sleep in the darkness of Sora's heart, or were welcomed into its warmth—they can be saved. All Sora needs to do is be himself and follow wherever it is that his heart takes him. It is the best and the only way.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku about Sora.</small>
*"''The rest is in there.''"<br/>— <small>talking about the bottle.</small>
*"''Of course. Now why is it that you are here?''"<br/>— <small>asking Riku.</small>
*"''Don't tell me he's gone to sleep again?''"<br/>— <small>talking about Sora.</small>
*"''What, indeed? Never fear. Sora is safe.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku.</small>
*"''He's not here. You see, by defeating the Nightmare imprisoning Sora, you freed him.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku about Sora.</small>
*"''Then, you came here, and you were questioned by three young people. That was the final key to awaken him. Sora is awake. You can go home now.''"<br/>— <small>telling Riku that Sora is awakened.</small>
*"''Young man! I do not believe you ever told me your name.''"<br/>— <small>talking to Riku.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts III''===
*"''Tell me, will you stay here?''"<br/>— <small>asking Aqua at the Dark Margin.</small>
*"''The Destiny Islands.''"<br/>— <small>the connection between the Dark Margin and the Destiny Islands.</small>
*"''Yes. They are quite lovely—a far cry from this wasteland.''"<br/>— <small>describing the Destiny Islands.</small>
*"''These waters are the in-between of dark and light, its shores the margins of day and night. They brought you and I together, so why not also you and another?''"<br/>— <small>to Aqua.</small>
*"''"Master"? So now you mock me.''"<br/>— <small>greeting his apprentice, Xehanort's Heartless.</small>
*"''No more! I'll go.''"<br/>— <small>attempting to save Aqua.</small>
*"''Please. I have created enough victims.''"<br/>— <small>reminded of Roxas and Naminé.</small>
*"''I told you I did not take her. Her disappearance was why I put a stop to the research.''"<br/>— <small>talking about the test subject Ansem, Seeker of Darkness is looking for.</small>
*"''Roxas and Naminé... If there is any reason that I still draw breath, it is to atone for what I did to them.''"<br/>— <small>regretful of his past actions.</small>
*"''If you do find the girl, what is it that you expect will happen?''"<br/>— <small>asking Xehanort's Heartless.</small>
*"''You are completely deluded, Xehanort.''"<br/>— <small>to Xehanort's Heartless concerning the test subject.</small>
*"''You are Roxas's friends.''"<br/>— <small>recognizing Hayner, Pence and Olette.</small>
*"''Even, is that you? So...those Nobodies were your doing.''"<br/>— <small>meeting Vexen.</small>
*"''Ah, well met, little Ienzo.''"<br/>— <small>meeting Ienzo.</small>
*"''I think what matters is that you recognize the mistake. Peace, Ienzo. It was I who was consumed by hatred—who failed you in my obligations as your mentor. Forgive me.''"<br/>— <small>to a guilt-ridden Ienzo.</small>

===''Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory''===
*"''Something's wrong. Shut it down!''"<br/>— <small>when Kairi arrives at the Final World.</small>
*"''Where voices can't reach... The other side of our world, of reality... Unreality? A fictional world? I'm afraid such mysteries are beyond our comprehension.''"<br/>— <small>figuring out Xehanort's message.</small>
*"''Yes, perhaps. The three realms of our world—light, darkness, and between—these are all places we can travel to because they are on "our side." This also includes the worlds of memories, data, and dreams. If I am correct, then this "other side" of our world from which voices cannot reach must be a place outside of our reality. Namely, it must be unreality, or fiction. But...that is the extent of our knowledge.''"<br/>— <small>about the fictional world.</small>
